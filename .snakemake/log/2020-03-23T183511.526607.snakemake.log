Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
Terminating processes on user request, this might take some time.
MissingOutputException in line 5 of /Users/jagathvytheeswaran/SVFX/Snakefile:
Job completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds:
data/control_matrix_normalized.txt
data/disease_matrix_normalized.txt
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
